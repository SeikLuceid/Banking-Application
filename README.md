Banking Application

A project assigned to me during my time at Revature, as an expansion upon an earlier project by incorporating web services and web application practices to enhance a basic java console application and allow for a more intuitive user experience for end users.

Technologies Used
JDBC v4.2, 
Java v1.8 
PostgreSQL v13.2

Features
The Banking API will manage the bank accounts of its users. It will be managed by the Bank's employees and admins. 
Employees and Admins count as Standard users with additional abilities. 
All users must be able to update their personal information, such as username, password, first and last names, as well as email. 
Accounts owned by users must support withdrawal, deposit, and transfer. 
Transfer of funds should be allowed between accounts owned by the same user, as well as between accounts owned by different users. 
Standard users should be able to register and login to see their account information. 
They can have either Checking or Savings accounts. 
Employees can view all customer information, but not modify in any way. 
Admins can both view all user information, as well as directly modify it.

To-do list:
Would like to implement bootstrap to improve aesthetic quality of front end
Would also like to develop a responsive front end that scales to size of viewport
